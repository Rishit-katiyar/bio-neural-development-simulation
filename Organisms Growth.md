# Organisms Growth: Processes and Workings

1. **Neurogenesis**
   - *Process*: Generation of new neurons.
   - *Working*: Stem cells differentiate into neural progenitor cells, which undergo asymmetric division to produce neurons.

2. **Neural Migration**
   - *Process*: Movement of neurons to their designated locations in the developing brain.
   - *Working*: Neurons migrate along radial glial scaffolds, guided by chemotropic and adhesive cues.

3. **Axonogenesis**
   - *Process*: Outgrowth of axons from neuronal soma.
   - *Working*: Axonal growth cones navigate through the extracellular environment, guided by chemotropic cues towards their target cells.

4. **Dendritogenesis**
   - *Process*: Formation of dendritic branches from neuronal soma.
   - *Working*: Dendritic arbors extend and branch out under the influence of neurotrophic factors and synaptic activity.

5. **Synaptogenesis**
   - *Process*: Establishment of synaptic connections between neurons.
   - *Working*: Synaptic adhesion molecules facilitate the alignment of pre- and postsynaptic elements, leading to the formation of functional synapses.

6. **Molecular Signaling Pathways in Synapse Formation**
   - *Process*: Regulation of synapse formation by molecular signaling cascades.
   - *Working*: Wnt, Eph/ephrin, Notch, and TGF-Î² signaling pathways orchestrate the assembly and maturation of synaptic connections.

7. **Activity-Dependent Synapse Formation**
   - *Process*: Strengthening or elimination of synapses based on neural activity.
   - *Working*: Synaptic connections that are frequently activated undergo reinforcement through long-term potentiation (LTP), while inactive synapses may undergo elimination via long-term depression (LTD).

8. **Role of Neurotrophic Factors in Synapse Formation**
   - *Process*: Influence of neurotrophic factors on synapse formation and plasticity.
   - *Working*: Neurotrophins such as BDNF and NGF modulate synaptic transmission and dendritic spine formation, ensuring the integrity and functionality of neural circuits.

9. **Synaptic Pruning**
   - *Process*: Selective elimination of redundant synapses to refine neural circuits.
   - *Working*: Microglia-mediated synaptic engulfment removes excess synapses, optimizing synaptic connectivity and neural circuit function.

10. **Activity-Dependent and Experience-Dependent Pruning**
    - *Process*: Modulation of synaptic connectivity by neural activity and sensory experience.
    - *Working*: Synapses that are actively engaged or stimulated by sensory input are selectively preserved, while less active synapses may undergo elimination, aligning neural circuitry with environmental demands.
