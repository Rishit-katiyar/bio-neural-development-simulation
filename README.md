# bio-neural-development-simulation
A detailed simulation of neural development using OCaml, focusing on neuron growth, synapse formation, and synaptic pruning. This project leverages OCaml's functional programming paradigms to model the dynamic processes of neural network formation and adaptation. Includes real-time visualization of the neural network's evolution.
