# Bio-Neural Development Simulation ðŸ§ ðŸ”¬

Welcome to the Bio-Neural Development Simulation project! This project simulates the dynamic processes of neural development, including neuron growth, synapse formation, and synaptic pruning, using OCaml programming language. 

### Installation

To run the simulation, you'll need OCaml and Dune installed on your system. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
# Install OCaml
$ opam switch create 4.12.0
$ eval $(opam env)

# Install Dune
$ opam install dune
```

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/Rishit-katiyar/bio-neural-development-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   $ cd bio-neural-development-simulation
   ```

3. **Build and Run**

   ```bash
   $ make
   $ make run
   ```

### Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files and directories:

- **src/**: Contains OCaml source code files.
  - `neuron.ml`: Defines the neuron data type and related functions.
  - `synapse.ml`: Defines the synapse data type and related functions.
  - `simulation.ml`: Implements simulation logic including activity simulation and visualization.
  - `main.ml`: Entry point of the program.
- **_build/**: Directory generated by Dune for build artifacts.
- **Makefile**: Contains build and run commands.
- **dune**: Dune configuration file.
